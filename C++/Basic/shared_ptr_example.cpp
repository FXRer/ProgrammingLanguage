/* A shared_ptr is a container for raw pointers. It is a reference 
 * counting ownership model i.e. it maintains the reference count of its 
 * contained pointer in cooperation with all copies of the shared_ptr. 
 * So, the counter is incremented each time a new pointer points to the 
 * resource and decremented when destructor of object is called.
 * 
 * Reference Counting: It is a technique of storing the number of 
 * references, pointers or handles to a resource such as an object, 
 * block of memory, disk space or other resources.
 * 
 * An object referenced by the contained raw pointer will not be 
 * destroyed until reference count is greater than zero i.e. until all 
 * copies of shared_ptr have been deleted.
 * 
 * So, we should use shared_ptr when we want to assign one raw pointer 
 * to multiple owners.

/*
 * When to use shared_ptr?
 * 
 * Use shared_ptr if you want to share ownership of resource . Many 
 * shared_ptr can point to single resource. shared_ptr maintains 
 * reference count for this propose. when all shared_ptrâ€™s pointing to 
 * resource goes out of scope the resource is destroyed.
