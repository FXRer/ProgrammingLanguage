/* What is the use?
 * 
 * Virtual functions allow us to create a list of base class pointers 
 * and call methods of any of the derived classes without even knowing 
 * kind of derived class object. For example, consider a employee 
 * management software for an organization, let the code has a simple 
 * base class Employee , the class contains virtual functions like 
 * raiseSalary(), transfer(), promote(),.. etc. Different types of 
 * employees like Manager, Engineer, ..etc may have their own 
 * implementations of the virtual functions present in base class 
 * Employee. In our complete software, we just need to pass a list of 
 * employees everywhere and call appropriate functions without even 
 * knowing the type of employee. For example, we can easily raise salary 
 * of all employees by iterating through list of employees. Every type 
 * of employee may have its own logic in its class, we donâ€™t need to 
 * worry because if raiseSalary() is present for a specific employee 
 * type, only that function would be called.
